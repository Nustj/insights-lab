# Anastasia's Portfolio ðŸŽ¢
I use the data by calculating my monthly budget (yet somehow every week), counting the calories in my food (I eat sushi and chocolate bars regularly), and how much sleep I need in a week so I don't feel like a zombie. I love data, so welcome!

This is portfolio of data analytics projects showcasing skills in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

This is where raw data transforms into `insights`, numbers tell `stories`, and analytics drives `decisions`! 

# Project 1: Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

### [Project Overview](https://github.com/TuringCollegeSubmissions/aivanc-PYDA.4.4)

This project focuses on predicting the risk of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) using a Logistic Regression model. The dataset contains multiple clinical variables such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, BMI, and glucose levels. The goal is to build a predictive model that can assist in identifying individuals at higher risk of CHD.
The workflow included:
* Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, removed irrelevant features, and addressed potential data inconsistencies.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified key risk factors influencing CHD, such as age, smoking habits, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure.
* Model Development: Implemented a logistic regression model for binary classification of CHD risk.
* Performance Evaluation: Selected the most appropriate classification metrics and determined the optimal decision threshold for better risk assessment.
