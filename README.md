# Anastasia's Portfolio ðŸŽ¢
I use the data by calculating my monthly budget (yet somehow every week), counting the calories in my food (I eat sushi and chocolate bars regularly), and how much sleep I need in a week so I don't feel like a zombie. I love data, so welcome!

This is portfolio of data analytics projects showcasing skills in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

This is where raw data transforms into `insights`, numbers tell `stories`, and analytics drives `decisions`! 

# [Project 1: Cardiovascular Disease Prediction](https://github.com/TuringCollegeSubmissions/aivanc-PYDA.4.4)

### Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the risk of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) using a Logistic Regression model. The dataset contains multiple clinical variables such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, BMI, and glucose levels. The goal is to build a predictive model that can assist in identifying individuals at higher risk of CHD.
The workflow included:
* Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, removed irrelevant features, and addressed potential data inconsistencies.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified key risk factors influencing CHD, such as age, smoking habits, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure.
* Model Development: Implemented a logistic regression model for binary classification of CHD risk.
* Performance Evaluation: Selected the most appropriate classification metrics and determined the optimal decision threshold for better risk assessment.

# [Project 2: Order Forecasting for ERP System]()
In this project, I aim to build a forecasting model to predict future orders based on historical order data for an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. Accurate forecasting of order volumes is critical for businesses to optimize their inventory management, procurement, and production planning.

The forecasting model I will develop uses time series analysis to predict future orders based on the past data. I will apply a Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model, which is an extension of the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model that accounts for both non-seasonal and seasonal components in time series data.

# Project 3: Melbourne House Price Prediction
### Project Overview
In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of the Melbourne housing market, focusing on predictive modeling for property prices. I cleaned and preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values, removing irrelevant columns, and addressing outliers. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), I identified key factors influencing house prices and built a regression model to predict them.

# [Project 4: Coursera Course Dataset Analysis](https://github.com/TuringCollegeSubmissions/aivanc-PYDA.3.5)
### Project Overview
This project analyzes the Coursera Course Dataset using Python. It includes loading, cleaning, performing exploratory data analysis, and visualizing key trends. The goal is to extract insights and suggest improvements for further analysis.
As a result,:
* The most popular course organizations and their course offerings were identified.
* Insights into course distribution by difficulty level and rating were visualized.
* Recommendations for improving data analysis include further segmentation by course price and lenght.

# [Project 5: Marketing Campaign Analysis](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pc6ISz6b9Y7QaQ60OowUrMy310eFiqQHEpfmhmeuTpM/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
### Project Overview
This analysis evaluates the effectiveness of three marketing promotions (Promotion 1, Promotion 2, and Promotion 3) in driving sales, using A/B Testing.
Key steps included:
Summarizing sales data by promotion and location.

Conducting pairwise statistical comparisons between promotions.

Identifying the most effective promotion based on sales performance.

Outcome:
Promotion 1 emerged as the most effective, showing a significant sales increase compared to Promotion 2.

No significant difference was found between other campaigns.
